# Funda | Quick, Hack, Prototype for Concept
	v0.1.0
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_funda/master/images/app.jpg)

This prototype was created to provide users with information about services in the neighborhoods where the houses are located. Services like bars, gyms, schools and parks are supported for now. The app wil calculate the match a neighborhood has by looking at the user's preferences. This happens everytime the user pans through the map and stops.

# Features
+ Shows services in neighborhoods
+ Gives detail information about services
+ Calculates Match based on user preference

# Wishlist
+ Get rid of the bug where you need to reload the map-page sometimes
+ Removing of duplicate services in case there are any
+ Have the app live inside one IFEE
+ More robust way of calculation the neighborhood match
